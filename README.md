# SHSE-master

Benchmark datasets and source code for the paper "SHSE: A Subspace Hybrid Sampling Ensemble Method for Software Defect Number Prediction".

# Usage of SHSE
- Step1: Download and unzip SHSE-master;
- Step2: Open MATLAB and add the path of SHSE-master and its subfolders;
- Step3: Add the absolute path of weka.jar into the classpath.txt of MATLAB;
- Step4: Enter folder SHSE and open the script Experiment.m in MATLAB Editor;
- Step5: Click the run button in the manu of MATLAB Editor to run the example;
 
Note that owing to the randomness in the algorithm and the differences between different devices, the experimental results may have a slight fluctuation compared with that as presented in the paper.
